# Insights Interact Toolkit

## Install

**Note:** The repo can be cloned to anywhere. `$HOME` is used as default for a
global installation.

1. Clone the repository

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:bastilian/insights-interact-tools.git $HOME/.insights-interact
```

2. Install node packages via

```shell
$ cd $HOME/.insights-interact && npm install
```

3. (optional) Add an alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```
alias insights-interact="node $HOME/.insights-interact/index.js"
```

## CLI Usage

To see a list of commands and flags use `--help`

```shell
$ insights-interact --help
$ # or without the alias
$ npm run test -- setup init
```

## Initialising

For most scripts to work the repos need to be configured and cloned. This can be
done via two commands:

```shell
$ insights-interact setup init # Will setup the configuration at `.insights-interact.yml`
$ insights-interact setup apps # Will clone all repositories and install packages
```

## Adding a new command

To add a new command create a JavaScript module exporting an async function in
any of the `./commands` sub-directories. The command will be executable via

```shell
$ insights-interact SUB_DIRECTORY JS_FILENAME
```

The module can also export a `help` and `flags` property to define a help text
shown in `--help` and flags that can be provided

### Command module boilerplate

```js
export const flags = {
  flagName: {
    type: "string",
    alias: ["c"],
    description: "Shell command to run",
  },
};

export const help = `
  HELP TEXT
`;

export default async (
  cli, // object returned from meow
  config, // config object created from ~/.insights-interact.yml (or provided config)
) => {
  // Run things run
};
```
